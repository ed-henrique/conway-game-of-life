# Conway's Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life written in Go.

## Why?

I was bored and found some article on the internet about this game, so I've got to do it myself.

## Demo

## How to Run

Ensure that you have Go 1.22+ installed, then execute the commands below:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ed-henrique/conway-game-of-life.git
cd conway-game-of-life
go run main.go
```

Press CTRL+C to exit the simulation.

If you want, you can change the `GRID_SIZE` and `TPF` (Time per frame in milliseconds) in the `main.go` file to values that please you.
